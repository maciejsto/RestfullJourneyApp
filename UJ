Build a RESTy API that implements the necessary endpoints for the following user journeys: 

UJ1: 

A user downloads the app and wants to register. 
Therefore the user needs to enter an email address and a password. 

UJ2: 

A registered user signs in by entering her email address and password. 
After login she adds her first insurance contract. She enters a title, the name of the insurance company and adds the yearly price. 

UJ3: 

After the user has added the new contract she realizes that she has a typo in the title and and corrects it. 

UJ4: 

An insurance agent recommends the user to cancel an unnecessary insurance. 
After cancelling she deletes the corresponding contract from the list. 

Authentication 

After successful login the server sends an auth token to the client. 
This token will be sent in all further requests within the HTTP header (Authorization: Bearer <token>). 

Notes 



●  Use node.js 



●  For data storage you can use either SQL or NoSQL — just as you like 



●  Use Git and make your code available via GitHub or Bitbucket 



●  Be pragmatic 



●  Use appropriate tools, libraries and frameworks to make your life easy 



●  Integration tests (e.g. with the package supertest ) are sufficient 



●  Using TypeScript is a bonus
